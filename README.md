# ‚ôªÔ∏è Automated Report Triage (Azure Function App)

## üìò Overview

**Automated Report Triage** is an Azure-based automation solution designed to eliminate the daily manual reconciliation process of vendor reports.  
Our team previously spent **up to one hour per day** downloading and organizing reconciliation reports sent via email.  
This automation frees up **250+ hours per year**, reduces manual errors, and ensures consistent organization of reports in **SharePoint**.

## üöÄ Problem Statement

### The Problem: Manual Reconciliation Workflow
Currently, team members must:
1. Open vendor emails.
2. Manually download attachments.
3. Save them into the correct vendor folder in SharePoint.

This **manual process**:
- Consumes up to **1 hour per day**.
- Introduces **risk of human error** (misplaced files, missed attachments).
- Pulls time away from **core reconciliation tasks**.

## üí° Our Solution: Automated Report Triage

The proposed **Azure Function App** automates the initial, repetitive tasks of the reconciliation workflow.

### üîÑ How It Works

1. **Email Ingestion**  
   - The azure function is granted access to a designated **Microsoft 365 mailbox**.  
   - Vendors send reconciliation reports to this mailbox.  

2. **Smart Triaging**  
   - The azure function identifies the vendor by **email domain** (e.g. `@redtiger.com`).  
   - Automatically **downloads attachments**.  
   - Uploads them to the **correct vendor folder** in **SharePoint**.

3. **Daily Summary Report (4:00 PM)**  
   - A **timer-triggered Azure Function** generates a daily summary.  
   - The summary lists all vendors from whom reports were received.  
   - Sent via email to stakeholders for visibility.
